This session will walk ArcPy users through a simple and practical approach to more quickly convert Python scripts to script tools in ArcGIS. We will also cover how to approach error handling and troubleshooting.\n",

But, you know, they want to be able to do this one task, that they insist on doing themselves, much more effeciently. So, they come to you, and you say, \"Ahhh yeah!! This is a job for Python!\" And they say, \"Monty Python? I love that movie!\" And you say, \"Um...no, no, no, no, no...\"\n",
