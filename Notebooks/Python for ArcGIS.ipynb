    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming tools are now a standard feature within GIS software packages and allow GIS users to automate, speed up, and become more robust in their data management and analytic work. This workshop is designed for GIS users who have some experience with Python programming, but who want to take their Python skills to the next level in ArcGIS. The workshop will focus on the ArcPy Python site package in ArcGIS with hands-on exercises designed to provide the essential skills to use Python in ArcGIS for effectively. Participants will learn to use ArcPy tools, build standalone geoprocessing scripts, and cover how to create custom script tools in ArcGIS toolboxes for reuse and sharing. Participants will also develop skills to explore more resources and options for utilizing Python in ArcGIS. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE: Basic Python programming will not be covered in this workshop, so participants are expected to know some basic Python concepts such as syntax, variables, data types (strings, numbers, Booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.) conditional statements, functions, and loops.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Topics Include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work with the ArcPy Python site package for ArcGIS\n",
    "* Explore the difference between Python scripts, Notebooks, and ModelBuilder models\n",
    "* Build and share custom ArcGIS script tools for automation\n",
    "* Learn tips and tricks for validating script syntax and error handling\n"

Formerly, he was the GIS Research Scientist for the Carnegie Museum of Natural History where he managed the GIS Lab at Powdermill Nature Reserve, the Museum’s environmental research center, and supported museum staff and affiliated researchers with geospatial technologies and needs. Whitacre was also the GIS Manager from 2011 to 2014 at the Museum. Before returning to the Museum in 2018, Whitacre was the GIS Specialist for the Main Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he provided GIS consultations for researchers and scholars, and taught GIS workshops to promote the use of GIS in research. Whitacre holds a Bachelor of Arts in Zoology from Ohio Wesleyan University and a Master of Science in Geography, concentrating on GIS and cartography, from Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

It is interpreted and dynamically typed and is suited for interactive work and quick prototyping of one-off programs known as scripts while being powerful enough to write large applications in. ArcGIS applications written with ArcPy benefit from the development of additional modules in numerous niches of Python by GIS professionals and programmers from many different disciplines.\n",
